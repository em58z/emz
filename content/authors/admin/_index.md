I am a political science PhD Student at the [Harry S Truman School of Government & Public Affairs](https://truman.missouri.edu) at the University of Missouri. Before moving to Missouri, I received my BA in Political Science and History from the [University of Rhode Island]([https://web.uri/.edu/politicalscience](https://web.uri.edu/politicalscience/). I am interested in international relations and comparative politics and my research interests are focused on femicide and violence against women. 

You can download a copy of my Curriculum Vitae {{< staticref "emma_mariano_CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.

As a bit of non-academic background, I was born and raised in East Greenwich, RI, located on the coast of the Atlantic. I have experience working in internationally focused non-profits and business management. In my free time you can probably find me at the ice rink figure skating!
